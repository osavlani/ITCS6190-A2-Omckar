/**
 * Mapper for the document similarity job.
 *
 * Input: one line of the input file per call. Each line is one document:
 *   "<DocumentID> <text of the document...>"
 * The key is the byte offset of the line in the file (you will not need it).
 *
 * Output: TODO — decide what your mapper emits. Whatever you choose, the reducer must be
 * able to reconstruct, for every pair of documents, how many distinct words the two
 * documents share and how many distinct words they have in total.
 *
 * Tokenization rules (the same for everyone, so outputs are comparable):
 * - the document ID is the first whitespace-delimited token of the line
 * - convert the rest of the line to lower case and split it on whitespace
 * - strip every character that is not a-z or 0-9 from each token ("Hadoop," -> "hadoop")
 * - drop tokens that are empty after stripping
 * - a document is the SET of its tokens: a word that appears twice counts once
 *
 * The generic types below match the design suggested in README.md. You may change them if
 * you choose a different design — just keep them consistent with the reducer and driver.
